cscjvm - C# to JVM compiler
==============================

cscjvm is a C# to JVM compiler.  Like the normal `csc` command, it accepts a list of files on the command line and produces a result, except in this case the result is a JAR file instead of a .NET assembly.

cscjvm is currently in very early development.  The goal is to be able to compile C# projects to the JVM such that they can run on Android, without having to rely on proprietary APIs.
